# Dataset associated with the project titled "Phenotypic And Genotypic Antimicrobial Susceptibility Of Non-Aureus Staphylococci In Dairy Goats" by Michelle P. Buckley, Fazal Sattar, Orhan Sahin, Ganwu Li, Roselle C. Busch, Amanda J. Kreuder, Paul J. Plummer, Patrick J. Gorden.
This study utilized broth microdilution testing and whole-genome sequencing to assess phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance of non-aureus staphylococci isolates cultured from caprine udders immediately prior to dry-off. Isolates were collected before antimicrobial treatment with one of two commercially available long-acting intramammary antibiotics and again after kidding. Isolates that were the same species at both time points were considered non-cured infections and isolates were compared using antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing. New infections that developed during the dry period were also evaluated in the same manner.
